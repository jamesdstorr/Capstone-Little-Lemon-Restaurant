# Capstone-Little-Lemon-Restaurant
A Capstone Project for the Meta Front End Developer Course. 

This project aims to demonstrate an understanding of the fundementals of React and Software Design, learned through the Meta Front End Developer course.  

In this project, I have designed and built a web application for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon, which includes a table booking system.
